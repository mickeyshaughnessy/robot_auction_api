        <h1>ü§ñ Robot Services Exchange (RSX) FAQ</h1>

        <h2>General Information</h2>

        <div class="question">What is the Robot Services Exchange (RSX)?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The Robot Services Exchange (RSX) is a new platform that connects individuals or businesses in need of robot services (buyers) with robot owners or operators (sellers). It serves as a marketplace where buyers can post service requests, and sellers can offer their robots' capabilities to fulfill these requests. RSX streamlines the process of finding, hiring, and managing robot services across various industries, enabling efficient and cost-effective solutions.
        </div>

        <div class="question">How does RSX work?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            RSX operates through a dynamic bidding and matching system:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bid Submission:</strong> Buyers post service requests by submitting bids, specifying details such as the type of service required, location, desired price, and the deadline for completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Search:</strong> Robot owners (sellers) can search for available bids that match their robots' services and operational area.</li>
                <li><strong>Matching and Acceptance:</strong> The system matches bids to robots based on service compatibility, location proximity, and pricing.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Execution:</strong> Once matched, the robot is dispatched to perform the requested service as per the agreed terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Completion and Rating:</strong> Upon completion, both buyers and sellers can rate each other, providing feedback to maintain quality and trust within the platform.</li>
            </ol>
            This system ensures efficient allocation of robot services, competitive pricing, and transparent transactions between buyers and sellers.

            </ol>
            Example bid payload:
            <pre>
{
    "service": "delivery",
    "lat": 37.7749,
    "lon": -122.4194,
    "price": 75.00,
    "end_time": 1700000000
}
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div class="question">How do sellers find and accept jobs?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Sellers can find jobs using the <code>/grab_job</code> endpoint. Here's how:
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure you have registered and logged in to obtain an authentication token.</li>
                <li>Prepare your robot's data, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>service:</strong> The services your robot can perform (comma-separated if multiple).</li>
                        <li><strong>lat:</strong> Current latitude of your robot.</li>
                        <li><strong>lon:</strong> Current longitude of your robot.</li>
                        <li><strong>max_distance:</strong> Maximum distance (in miles) your robot can travel for a job.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Send a POST request to <code>/grab_job</code> with your robot's data in JSON format, including your authentication token in the header.</li>
            </ol>
            Example grab job request:
            <pre>
{
    "service": "cleaning,delivery",
    "lat": 34.0522,
    "lon": -118.2437,
    "max_distance": 15
}
            </pre>
            If a matching job is found, the response will include job details:
            <pre>
{
    "job_id": "987f6543-e21b-65d4-c321-654987321000",
    "service": "cleaning",
    "lat": 34.0500,

        <h2>RSX Protocol Details</h2>

        <div class="question">How does the RSX protocol match bids to robots?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The RSX protocol matches bids to robots through the following process:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bid Storage:</strong> Buyers' bids are stored with details like service type, location, price, and end time.</li>
                <li><strong>Seller Search:</strong> Sellers use <code>/grab_job</code> to search for jobs matching their robots' capabilities and location.</li>
                <li><strong>Matching Criteria:</strong> The system filters bids based on:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Service Compatibility:</strong> The robot's services must match the bid's service requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Proximity:</strong> The job must be within the robot's maximum travel distance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> The robot must be able to complete the job before the bid's end time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
