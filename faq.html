        <h1>Robot Services Exchange (RSX) FAQ</h1>

        <h2>General Information</h2>

        <div class="question">What is the Robot Services Exchange (RSX)?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The Robot Services Exchange (RSX) is a platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of robot services. It acts as an intermediary between robot owners (sellers) and people who need robot services (buyers). Think of it as a job board for robots, where tasks are posted and robots are assigned to complete them.
        </div>

        <div class="question">How does RSX work?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            RSX works through a bidding system:
            <ol>
                <li>Buyers submit bids for specific services they need, including details like the type of service, location, price, and time frame.</li>
                <li>Robot owners (sellers) can browse available jobs and accept those that match their robots' capabilities and location.</li>
                <li>When a match is made, the buyer pays for the service, the robot performs the task, and then the seller is paid.</li>
            </ol>
            This system allows for dynamic pricing and efficient allocation of robot resources based on supply and demand.
        </div>

        <h2>For Buyers</h2>

        <div class="question">How do I place a bid for a robot service?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            To place a bid, you need to use the `/make_bid` endpoint of our API. Here's a step-by-step process:
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure you have registered an account and obtained an authentication token.</li>
                <li>Prepare your bid data, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>service: The type of service you need (e.g., cleaning, delivery)</li>
                        <li>lat: Latitude of the service location</li>
                        <li>lon: Longitude of the service location</li>
                        <li>price: Your bid price for the service (in USD)</li>
                        <li>end_time: The deadline for the service (in Unix timestamp format)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Send a POST request to `https://100.26.236.1:5001/make_bid` with your bid data in JSON format, including your authentication token in the header.</li>
            </ol>
            The system will then process your bid and make it available for robot owners to accept.
        </div>

        <h2>RSX Protocol Details</h2>

        <div class="question">How does a buyer client interact with the RSX protocol?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A buyer client interacts with the RSX protocol through the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> 
                    <ul>

            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="question">What are the key differences between buyer and seller interactions in the RSX protocol?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The key differences are:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bid vs. Job:</strong> Buyers create bids for services, while sellers search for and accept jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Proactive vs. Reactive:</strong> Buyers proactively place bids, while sellers reactively search for available jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Provided:</strong> Buyers specify service details and price, while sellers provide robot capabilities and location.</li>
                <li><strong>Endpoints Used:</strong> Buyers primarily use `/make_bid` and `/nearby`, while sellers mainly use `/grab_job`.</li>
                <li><strong>Client Implementation:</strong> Buyer clients are typically user-facing applications, while seller clients (like RobotOwnerClient) often run autonomously.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">How does the RSX protocol handle matching bids to robots?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The RSX protocol matches bids to robots through the following process:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bid Storage:</strong> When a buyer submits a bid, it's stored in the system with its details (service, location, price, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Job Search:</strong> When a seller's robot searches for jobs, the system:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filters bids based on the robot's capabilities (services it can perform).</li>
                        <li>Checks if the bid's location is within the robot's specified max_distance.</li>
                        <li>Considers the bid's end_time to ensure the robot can complete the job in time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Price Matching:</strong> If multiple robots qualify for a job, the one accepting the lowest price gets the job.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Assignment:</strong> Once a match is found, the job is assigned to the robot and removed from the available bids.</li>
            </ol>
            This process ensures efficient matching of services to capable robots while respecting location constraints and competitive pricing.
        </div>

        <div class="question">How does the RSX protocol ensure fair competition among sellers?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The RSX protocol promotes fair competition through several mechanisms:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Price-based Assignment:</strong> Jobs are typically assigned to the robot accepting the lowest price, encouraging competitive pricing.</li>
                <li><strong>Location-based Matching:</strong> By considering robot locations and max_distance, the system ensures that distant robots don't unfairly compete with local ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Capability Filtering:</strong> Only robots with the required capabilities are considered for each job, ensuring fair competition among qualified robots.</li>
                <li><strong>Rating System:</strong> The `/sign_job` endpoint allows buyers to rate services, which can influence future job assignments, encouraging high-quality service.</li>
                <li><strong>Equal Access to Jobs:</strong> The `/grab_job` endpoint provides all registered robots equal opportunity to search for and accept available jobs.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
