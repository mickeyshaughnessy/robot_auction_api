        <h1>Robot Services Exchange (RSX) FAQ</h1>

        <h2>General Information</h2>

        <div class="question">What is the Robot Services Exchange (RSX)?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The Robot Services Exchange (RSX) is a platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of robot services. It acts as an intermediary between robot owners (sellers) and people who need robot services (buyers). Think of it as a job board for robots, where tasks are posted and robots are assigned to complete them.
        </div>

        <div class="question">How does RSX work?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            RSX works through a bidding system:
            <ol>
                <li>Buyers submit bids for specific services they need, including details like the type of service, location, price, and time frame.</li>
                <li>Robot owners (sellers) can browse available jobs and accept those that match their robots' capabilities and location.</li>
                <li>When a match is made, the buyer pays for the service, the robot performs the task, and then the seller is paid.</li>
            </ol>
            This system allows for dynamic pricing and efficient allocation of robot resources based on supply and demand.

        <h2>For Buyers</h2>

        <div class="question">How do I place a bid for a robot service?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            To place a bid, you need to use the `/make_bid` endpoint of our API. Here's a step-by-step process:
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure you have registered an account and obtained an authentication token.</li>
                <li>Prepare your bid data, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>service: The type of service you need (e.g., cleaning, delivery)</li>
                        <li>lat: Latitude of the service location</li>
                        <li>lon: Longitude of the service location</li>
                        <li>price: Your bid price for the service (in USD)</li>
                        <li>end_time: The deadline for the service (in Unix timestamp format)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Send a POST request to `https://100.26.236.1:5001/make_bid` with your bid data in JSON format, including your authentication token in the header.</li>
            </ol>
            The system will then process your bid and make it available for robot owners to accept.

        <h2>Technical Information</h2>

        <div class="question">What technologies does RSX use?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            RSX is built using a variety of modern technologies:
            <ul>
                <li>Backend: The core API is built with Python using the Flask framework.</li>
                <li>Database: We use Redis for fast, in-memory data storage and retrieval.</li>
                <li>Server: The application is served using Gunicorn, a Python WSGI HTTP Server.</li>
                <li>Frontend: The dashboard uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Leaflet library for mapping.</li>
                <li>API Communication: RESTful API endpoints are used for all client-server communication.</li>
                <li>Authentication: We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.</li>
            </ul>
            This tech stack allows for a scalable, efficient, and secure platform for robot service exchange.
