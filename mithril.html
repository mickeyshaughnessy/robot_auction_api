                            <p>I'm Mickey Shaughnessy, the creator of Project Mithril. With over two decades of experience in internet software and machine learning, I've dedicated my career to delivering value for everyone through software engineering and having fun with computers.</p>
                            <p>Over the last 5 years I've developed powerful AI-based ad tracking and targeting algorithms to adapt to changing privacy and data environments. Now, I see a critical need for a solution to shield individuals from invasive tracking and targeting.</p>
                            <p>When I'm not confusing robots I enjoy playing with my 4 kids in Lakewood, CO, mountain biking, and cooking for our friends and family.</p>
                            <p>I'm excited to share Project Mithril with you. Sign up for the newsletter, grab an alpha seat, enjoy the demo game, or just take in the sweet AI video creations of Tony M.</p>

                            <p>I have 20 years of experience in software development. I am a computer engineer from IIT Dhanbad, India and an MBA from UC Davis, California. In the last 20 years, I have been in the role of a developer, engineering manager and product development with responsibilities ranging from software development to product specifications.</p>
                            <p>At most of the projects I have worked, I have got opportunity to learn about lifecycle of product development and how software links to business. Apart from programming languages i have keen interest in building high throughput, low latency infrastructure. I have built and managed, multi-Terabyte scale data warehouse and programmatic bidding elastic infrastructure that handles billion requests per minute.</p>
                            <p>I have worked 16 years in Adtech and I am very fascinated with the challenges of this business - both for tech and business. I have been involved in solving very challenging problems of Bid auction pricing and automated campaign optimization algorithms.</p>
