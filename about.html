    <p> My name is Mickey Shaughnessy and I'm the creator of the Robot Services Exchange. I did it so that you and yours could get cheap and easy access to robot services. I thought to myself "The reason I don't want to buy a robot is that it would sit idle most of the time.". What if there was a way for people to place bids for the services they wanted, so that robot owners could get their robots things to do? Enter The Robot Services Exchange and the RSX protocol... </p>
